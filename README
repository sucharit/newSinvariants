The main program is main.sage. The wrapper.sage runs the main program
on the knots that are described in extracted.sage. The default version
of extracted.sage contains knot information for all knots up to 11
crossings, and their mirrors. For example, if you only want to study
the Conway knot, your extracted.sage could look like the following.

===
all_knots=['Conway',]

Conway_pd=[[4, 2, 5, 1], [8, 4, 9, 3], [12, 5, 13, 6], [2, 8, 3, 7], [9, 17, 10, 16], [11, 18, 12, 19], [6, 13, 7, 14], [15, 20, 16, 21], [17, 1, 18, 22], [19, 14, 20, 15], [21, 10, 22, 11]]
Conway_hom={(-5, -9): 2, (-6, -11): 1, (1, 3): 1, (5, 9): 1, (4, 7): 2, (-2, -3): 3, (-3, -7): 3, (-2, -7): 1, (1, -1): 3, (3, 3): 2, (-1, -1): 2, (3, 5): 2, (-4, -7): 2, (1, 1): 4, (-1, -5): 2, (-5, -11): 2, (4, 5): 2, (-2, -5): 4, (-1, -3): 4, (2, 3): 3, (2, 1): 3, (0, -3): 2, (-3, -5): 3, (0, 1): 3, (-6, -13): 1, (-4, -9): 2, (5, 7): 1, (0, -1): 5}
Conway_rasmus=0

The pd is the PD-presentation information from
http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/Planar_Diagrams. The rasmus is the
original Rasmussen's s-invariant. The hom is the Khovanov homology of
the knot over F_2, presented as a dictionary; for example, (-5,-9):2
means the Khovanov homology in bigrading (-5,-9) has rank 2 over
F_2. These three pieces of data can be generated from the Mathematica
program KnotTheory
(http://katlas.math.toronto.edu/wiki/The_Mathematica_Package_KnotTheory),
or by some other direct means.

The wrapper.sage program runs the main.sage program on the knots
described in extracted.sage, and produces a single output file
output.txt. That file contains precisely the knots for which
s_+^{Sq^2} is greater than s. (If you want to check if s_-^{Sq^2} is
smaller than s, you have to work with the mirror, as per the
definition.)

A word of caution: The program is fairly slow, and isn't expected to
work for high (>13) crossing knots.


**********************************
Here is a step by step guideline on how to recompute the data. Note,
this process will regenerate the file output.txt.

-Install Sage. (Visit http://www.sagemath.org/)

-Install the Sage package CHomP. (Visit
http://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/)

-Open a terminal, go to the directory where you have downloaded all
the files of newSinvariants.  Henceforth, we are assuming that you are
using a shell where the command "sage" is configured to run the
program Sage.
 
-Run the wrapper program on all the knots in extracted.sage The
program takes a long time, so it is better to use nohup.
nohup sage wrapper.sage > /dev/null 2> /dev/null < /dev/null &
